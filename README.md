## About the Program
***~~Group 22 Project~~*** is a program intented to provide an easy to 
use system for managing a sustainable furniture supply chain, 
where individual components of old furniture can be reconfigured
into recycled items for a low cost.

By using a database of furniture, individual components, and their manufacturers, 
the cost, configuration, and all possible combinations for creating a furniture item can be 
quickly compiled and displayed. In addition to managing the database for the supply chain,
***~~Group 22 Project~~*** can produced a seperate order
invoice at the same time as orders are processed.
